In order to work, the software, needs as input a pandas dataframe built as follows:
  x      ||       y     ||       z  || ClassNamePrediction1 || ... || ClassNamePrediction n  || GroundTruth
float32  ||   float32   || float32  ||      float32         || ... ||         float32        ||     uint16   


This dataframe must be saved as a pickle file (.pkl) in order to be correctly loaded.
